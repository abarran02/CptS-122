# WSU CptS 122 for Spring 2022
This repository includes all C++ programming assignments for my Spring 2022 semester. 
It is evidence of my learning process of C++, data structures, and Git, and is not necessarily a reflection of my current skills or understanding.

As the class required using Microsoft Visual Studio for submitting assignments, all ``.sln`` files are included. This was created by merging previous assignment repositories into a single master repository for better organization.
